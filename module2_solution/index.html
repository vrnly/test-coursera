            <h2>Panda Power Lunch</h1>

                <p>Pandas are professional eaters—they can munch on bamboo for up to 12 hours every single day. Even though bamboo does not have much nutrition, 
                    pandas manage to eat so much of it that it keeps them going. Basically, they are fluffy eating machines.</p>

            <h2>Hedgehog Defense Mode</h1>
        
                <p>When danger shows up, hedgehogs don’t run away—they curl up into a perfect little ball of spikes.
                    Their sharp spines act like built-in armor, keeping most predators from bothering them. Cute, but also tough!</p>

            <h2>The Cheeky Kea</h1>
        
                <p>The kea is a parrot from New Zealand, famous for being curious, clever, and a little bit naughty. These birds love puzzles, play with objects they find, 
                    and have even been caught stealing snacks, shiny things, and sometimes windshield wipers from cars. </p>
